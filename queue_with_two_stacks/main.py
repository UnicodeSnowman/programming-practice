# Complexity
# Each enqueue is clearly O(1)O(1) time, and so is each dequeue when out_stack has items. Dequeue on an empty out_stack is order of the number of items in in_stack at that moment, which can vary significantly.
# 
# Notice that the more expensive a dequeue on an empty out_stack is (that is, the more items we have to move from in_stack to out_stack), the more O(1)O(1)-time dequeues off of a non-empty out_stack it wins us in the future. Once items are moved from in_stack to out_stack they just sit there, ready to be dequeued in O(1) time. An item never moves "backwards" in our data structure.
# 
# We might guess that this "averages out" so that in a set of mm enqueues and dequeues the total cost of all dequeues is actually just O(m)O(m). To check this rigorously, we can use the accounting method â†´ , counting the time cost per item instead of per enqueue or dequeue.
# 
# So let's look at the worst case for a single item, which is the case where it is enqueued and then later dequeued. In this case, the item enters in_stack (costing 1 push), then later moves to out_stack (costing 1 pop and 1 push), then later comes off out_stack to get returned (costing 1 pop).
# 
# Each of these 4 pushes and pops is O(1)O(1) time. So our total cost per item is O(1)O(1). Our mm enqueue and dequeue operations put mm or fewer items into the system, giving a total runtime of O(m)O(m)!
