### Two Egg Problem

# A building has 100 floors. One of the floors is the highest floor an egg can be dropped from without breaking.
# 
# If an egg is dropped from above that floor, it will break. If it is dropped from that floor or below, 
# it will be completely undamaged and you can drop the egg again.
# 
# Given two eggs, find the highest floor an egg can be dropped from without breaking, with as few drops as possible.

naive solution: drop at 50, drop at 75, etc. until egg 1 breaks, then drop from the 1+ the last known safe height.

(apparently) we can do better...

skip less than 1/2 floors each time. if we skip 10 each time, worst case is 19 drops
    - first egg 10 times, 2nd egg 9 times

* the worse case total number of drops increases by one each time the first egg doesn't break *

how can we keep the worst case amount from increasing each time first egg doesn't break?
