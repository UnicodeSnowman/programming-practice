### Two Egg Problem

# A building has 100 floors. One of the floors is the highest floor an egg can be dropped from without breaking.
# 
# If an egg is dropped from above that floor, it will break. If it is dropped from that floor or below, 
# it will be completely undamaged and you can drop the egg again.
# 
# Given two eggs, find the highest floor an egg can be dropped from without breaking, with as few drops as possible.

naive solution: drop at 50, drop at 75, etc. until egg 1 breaks, then drop from the 1+ the last known safe height.

(apparently) we can do better...

skip less than 1/2 floors each time. if we skip 10 each time, worst case is 19 drops
    - first egg 10 times, 2nd egg 9 times

* the worse case total number of drops increases by one each time the first egg doesn't break *

how can we keep the worst case amount from increasing each time first egg doesn't break?
    - skip one fewer floor each time we drop the first egg

how do we know how many floors to skip the first time?
    we know:
        - want to skip as few floors as possible the first time we drop (so that if it breaks, we don't have to count up a bunch)
        - we always want to be able to reduce the number of floors to skip by 1
so at the top, we really want to only skip one floor

so if n is the number of floors we skip the first time, and we skip 1 at the end...
n + (n - 1) + (n - 2) + ... + 1 = 100

were summing 1 -> n, it's a triangular series! https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Triangular_number
so...

(n + 1) * (n / 2) = 100 
=> n^2 + n - 200 = 0 => quadratic formula => 13.651 => round up to 14

so first drop from 14, second drop 13 floors higher at 27. at worst, this gives us a total drop number of 14
